      <h1>Security Research, Signal Noise, and a Mild Disrespect for Defaults</h1>
      <p>
        This space is for field notes, experiments, firmware spelunking, RF mischief,
        and whatever else breaks open when curiosity meets hardware.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expect teardown logs, odd protocol dissections, network archaeology,
        and the occasional rant about devices that should never have been connected
        to the internet but insisted on doing so anyway.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineering embedded systems</li>
        <li>Offensive security tooling and writeups</li>
        <li>Radio experimentation and SDR exploration</li>
        <li>Network mapping, automation, and self-hosted infrastructure</li>
        <li>Home lab experiments that may or may not void warranties</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Site Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Blog posts, lab notes, and long-form research live in <code>src/content/blog/</code>.
        Layouts and components follow a minimal, utilitarian structure built for quick iteration.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a workspace, not a showroom.
