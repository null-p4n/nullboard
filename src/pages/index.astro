      <h1>A Field Log of Chaos, Curiosity, and Whatever Fresh Disaster Today Brings</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to this ongoing chronicle of technological disappointment. Consider it a museum of
        crime scenes where the exhibits are firmware, radios, and network stacks that refuse to act
        like they’ve ever heard of reliability. If you came here expecting polish, clarity, or
        emotional stability, that’s adorable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of what you’ll find is the aftermath of experiments that began with optimism and ended
        with the familiar realization that we, as a species, insist on building systems we barely
        understand. I have spent literal weeks interrogating a single UART pin like it owed me rent.
        Every breakthrough arrives packaged with existential dread, and every failure comes with an
        encore.
      </p>

      <p>
        The current research stack includes ad‑hoc mobile networks that behave like feral animals,
        PicoKeys running RP2350s that insist on having opinions, radio work conducted at frequencies
        that definitely weren’t designed for my entertainment, and the occasionally thrilling,
        occasionally depressing world of chat control and digital rights. Sprinkle in some activism,
        not because it’s fun, but because someone has to clean up after the cryptographic elephants.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Experiments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Disassembling embedded systems and pretending I know how to reassemble them</li>
        <li>Developing offensive tooling with the grace and subtlety of a thrown appliance</li>
        <li>Tuning into the RF spectrum like the world’s least responsible radio astronomer</li>
        <li>Constructing networks that behave perfectly until I so much as acknowledge their existence</li>
        <li>Running a home lab that oscillates between scientific breakthrough and structural failure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How This Site Works</h2>
      <p>
        All logs, rants, forensics, and accidental discoveries live in
        <code>src/pages/blog/</code>. The UI remains aggressively minimal because anything more
        ornate would merely delay the inevitable moment when a reader realizes how catastrophically
        things have gone wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing here is curated for recruiters, executives, or anyone allergic to brutal honesty.
        This is documentation of failure, persistence, and the occasional miracle when a device
        finally obeys. Enjoy the spectacle.
