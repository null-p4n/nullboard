      <h1>A Manifesto of Silicon, Solder, and Subversion</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>This is not a portfolio. It is a blast radius.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Welcome to the command center of my ongoing war against hardware that lies, firmware that
        gaslights, and a surveillance state that never blinks. Here, we don't just fix things;
        we interrogate silicon until it confesses its secrets. This is a chronicle of questionable 
        engineering committed in the defense of privacy and the pursuit of chaos.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything here is the byproduct of insomnia and defiance. It starts with "this shouldn't 
        be hard" and ends with me engaging in psychological warfare against a lonely UART pin for 
        four weeks. Expect CTF write-ups that read like autopsies, hardware dissections that void 
        warranties and religious covenants, and the occasional smell of burning ozone.
      </p>

      <h2>The Current Insurgency</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Forging Cyber-Artifacts:</strong> Weaponizing the <strong>RP2350</strong> to build 
            <strong>PicoKeys</strong>—input devices designed for those who refuse to be limited by Yubico or sanity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Building Ghost Grids:</strong> Architecting <strong>ad-hoc mobile networks</strong> 
            that survive when the infrastructure crumbles. If the grid goes dark, we keep talking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Digital Self-Defense:</strong> Occasional activism against the encroaching shadow of 
            <strong>Chat Control</strong>. Privacy is not a feature; it is a riot.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Offensive Engineering:</strong> Tooling that probably violates the Geneva Convention for computers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Home Lab:</strong> A rack of servers that unites electricians, sysadmins, and 
            therapists in a chorus of concern.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How This Archive Works</h2>
      <p>
        All logs, rants, and post-mortems live in <code>src/pages/blog/</code>. The layout is minimal 
        because I am allergic to unnecessary UI. I prefer shoving raw information at readers with the 
        grace of a brick thrown through a window.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space isn't here to impress recruiters. It exists to document what breaks, why it broke, 
        and the specific sequence of hex codes required to make it behave again.
